## How it works

This desing implements a digital Operational Transconductance Amplifier using standard digital logic gates instead of using traditional analog components. 

## How to test

- Vip and Vin =   represent the two input signals to the digital OTA.

The OTA takes the difference between Vin and Vip, and generates a corresponding output depending on the chosen configuration.

## External hardware

Signal generator to generate the Vin and Vip and a oscilloscope to see the Output. Passive component to test diferent configurations.
